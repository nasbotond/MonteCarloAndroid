    <string name="intro_to_monte_carlo">Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms
        that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might
        deterministic in principle. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it
        is difficult or impossible to use other approaches.</string>
